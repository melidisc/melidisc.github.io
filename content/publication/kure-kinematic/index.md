abstract: "This paper presents KURE (Kinematic Universal Remote Interface), a novel human-centered approach to remote robot control. The system allows intuitive control of robotic systems through a natural interface that maps human movement to robot actions. By focusing on kinematic relationships rather than explicit programming, KURE enables more natural human-robot interaction, reducing the learning curve for operators and expanding accessibility for non-expert users."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "A human-centered remote robot control paradigm using kinematic mapping for intuitive interaction, presented at IEEE SMC in Budapest, Hungary."
