abstract: "This paper explores the application of self-organization principles to the design of intuitive interfaces for robot control. By leveraging concepts from adaptive systems and collective behavior, we develop control interfaces that dynamically organize themselves based on user interaction patterns. The approach allows for the emergence of personalized control schemes without explicit programming, creating more natural and effective human-robot interactions. Our prototype demonstrates how self-organizing interfaces can significantly reduce the learning curve for novice users while maintaining precise control capabilities for complex robotic systems. The results suggest a promising direction for next-generation human-robot interfaces that adapt to individual users rather than requiring users to adapt to predefined control paradigms."
