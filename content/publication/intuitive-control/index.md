abstract: "This paper presents a novel architectural framework for the integration of autonomous adaptive dynamic behaviors in mobile robots that enhances both navigation efficiency and user interaction. The architecture employs a combination of neural network approaches and adaptive algorithms to enable robots to develop increasingly intuitive control interfaces. By analyzing user interaction patterns and environmental factors, the system continuously adapts its behavior to align with user expectations and intentions. This approach significantly reduces the cognitive load on operators while improving task performance metrics. Experimental validation demonstrates how this architecture creates more natural and effective robot control experiences across various usage scenarios."
