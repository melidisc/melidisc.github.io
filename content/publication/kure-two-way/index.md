abstract: "This paper presents KURE as a two-way adaptive system that facilitates intuitive robot control through mutual adaptation between user and system. Unlike traditional unidirectional control interfaces, KURE implements a bidirectional learning mechanism that allows both the human operator and the robotic system to adapt to each other over time, resulting in increasingly natural interactions. The system utilizes principles from self-organization and machine learning to create a control interface that evolves with use, becoming personalized to individual operator preferences and control patterns."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
