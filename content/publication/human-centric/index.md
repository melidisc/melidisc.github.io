abstract: "This paper introduces a novel human-centric approach to robotic control that prioritizes user experience and natural interaction over traditional programming paradigms. By analyzing how humans naturally interact with physical systems, we develop control interfaces that leverage intuitive movement patterns and cognitive models. The research demonstrates how human-centric design principles can significantly reduce the learning curve for robot operators while improving task performance and user satisfaction. Experimental results from user studies show marked improvements in task completion times and reduced cognitive load compared to conventional control interfaces."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
